# W45 Ge Tracker

This plugin adds a new GE sidebar that will give you W45 prices.
The prices come from plugin users. The plugin will record all your GE trades (item id, price, time, and whether it is buy or sell). 

There is no graphs/historical data right now, just buy/sell prices and time. I will probably not make a website because the price tracking is reliant on user data collected by the plugin.

## Donations

I'm hoping the server costs will be low, but if you want to donate I have crypto addresses here.
